## Development


## White Paper

Chronoverse LLC plans to release a new class of collectible assets, in the form of NFTs, called Chrono-Capsules; And an accompanying fungible asset called Chrono-Token, via an ERC 1155 smart contract, in order to provide new ways for collectors to participate in the growth and proliferation of the Chronoverse, a Science Fiction Universe centered around exploring next-generation technologies such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and NFTs. We envision a world where Bitcoin and Ethereum rule the market, while Smart Contracts have been wholesale adopted to form the bedrock of the new global government.

Other themes explored by the Chronoverse include Automation and the future of work, genetic engineering and immortality, quantum computing, VR, BCI, and the future of digital realities. AI, artificial life, singularity, the cybernetic and transhumanism and all the other possibilities which stem from that. 

Chrono-Capsules are a class of smart collectible assets, in the form of NFTs, that allow collectors to capture value through their collectibles, directly from the growth and development of the Chronoverse!
