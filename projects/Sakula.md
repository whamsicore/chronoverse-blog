The Atlanteans are a super civilization that flourished 20 thousand years ago. They wielded but mysteriously disapeared 9000 years ago. They became masters of the world with the help of EWA crystals which allowed them to perceive and control pure energy. They became like gods, and nearly destroyed the world with their technology...

From the near death of their civilization they reformed into an enlightened race, with a religion based on a feeling... Sakula...

Sa-Ku-La, which in the Atlantean language literally means, Life-Death-Meeting place. 

Inspired by the Atlanteans, Chronoverse has created a special token for interactions with the ChronoToken NFT. The Sakula, denoted by the infinite symbol, âˆž, is a currency like none other. For it is programmed to have a limited lifespan of roughly 30 years, and all Sakulas will be locked in the year 2050. 

One last NFT will minted, and it will be called the "Chronoverse Sakula".

Sakulas are a utility which can be used to mint ChronoToken NFTs. They can also be staked on any ChronoToken NFT to receive a cut of the profits when the token is sold.
