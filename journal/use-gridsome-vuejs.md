## Who is Chronoverse for?

Are you concerned that technology is moving too fast for us to keep up? That mass surveillance systems will rob us of our basic freedoms? That most human jobs will be replaced by machines in the next 20 years? That the next war will be fought with killer drones and genetically engineered viruses? That our rapid growth will continue to disrupt the delicate balance of Earth and bring about complete ecological collapse?

Or, perhaps you are excited and optimistic... of the prospect that advanced genetic engineering could be used to eliminate all diseases, extend human life to live for hundreds of years, while staying young forever. Or, you are just itching to try next generation VR technology that could allow you to experience your greatest fantasies in the comfort (and privacy) of your home. Or, you believe technology can be used to eliminate poverty and social injustice all across the world, and bring about an age of peace, abundance, and enlightenment!

Whether you are exhilarated or terrified, one thing is for sure: technology will change EVERYTHING. Heck, we've witnessed it transform the world in the past 20 years. The only question is, when is the next paradigm shift going to occur?
