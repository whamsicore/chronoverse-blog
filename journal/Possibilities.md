Chronoverse 2042 offers 3 distinct classes for you to choose from: Cybermerks, Roboknights, and Linkers... Each offer unique possibilities of gear fitting, skill advancement, and social evolution.

Cyber-merks: They are the new warrior class of the future. They are private military for hire, investigators, and corporate spies. Since the arrival of incredibly powerful shield technology in the early 2030s, they have revived the ancient arts of melee combat, bringing plasma swords and spears and bows back into the fray.

Roboknights: Borne out of the horrors of the 5 year war, when mankind faced total annihilation, the Order Of Roboknights are a semi-religious organization which has arisen to defend against the temptations of Dark Tech and Technotocracy. They wage a physical and spiritual war against centralization and tech-corruption, equipped head-to-toe with exosuits powered by nano-fusion crystals.

Linker Class: They prefer to stay as far away from the battle as possible, while controlling machines and hacking into digital vaults from the safety of their homes, all through next-gen BCI technology which enables them to interface and control machines with the Riffs of their thoughts. They are meditation gurus, drug addicts of Fria, and E-Sports Superstars, and what all of them have in common is they spend far more time in virtual worlds than the default.

## The Gear

The Gear
Melee is back... 

Historically we've witnessed a trend towards ranged weapons, but all that has been reversed overnight by the invention of the "Shieldbelt", which instantly rendered most forms of projectile weapons irrelevant since 2028.

Soundsabers use ultra-sonic vibrations to manipulate "sword dust" (similar to the shield-dust used in shieldbelts to create forcefields) to "grow" the shape of the blade.
Swords in 2042 are similar to lightsabers from Star Wars, except they are more diverse in shape, color, and exterior texture. In the game you will be able to craft your own weapons to your needs through 3d printing technology. 

Like the lightsaber, plasma swords can also be retracted into the hilt when not in use. However, the principle of achieving this is quite different. Retractable plasma swords in Chronoverse are achieved through "Sword-dust" and "Sonoid Emitters". When activated, "Sword-dust" shoot out of the hilt to materialize in a matter of milliseconds according to the vibrations emitted by the "Sonoid Emitters".

Plasma typically enshrouds soundsabers so as to enable them to cut through thick graphene armor. Different swords operate under different vibrational frequencies to achieve different textures. Can you spot which style is typically used by protagonists, and which is used by villains?

Ranged Weapons in 2042: 1) Because of the proliferation of Shieldbelts and melee combat guns are often fitted with bayonets. 2) Plasma Chamber 3) Retractable Shock Absorber
