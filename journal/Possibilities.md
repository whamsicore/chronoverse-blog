Chronoverse 2042 offers 3 distinct classes for you to choose from: Cybermerks, Roboknights, and Linkers... Each offer unique possibilities of gear fitting, skill advancement, and social evolution.

Cyber-merks: They are the new warrior class of the future. They are private military for hire, investigators, and corporate spies. Since the arrival of incredibly powerful shield technology in the early 2030s, they have revived the ancient arts of melee combat, bringing plasma swords and spears and bows back into the fray.

Roboknights: Borne out of the horrors of the 5 year war, when mankind faced total annihilation, the Order Of Roboknights are a semi-religious organization which has arisen to defend against the temptations of Dark Tech and Technotocracy. They wage a physical and spiritual war against centralization and tech-corruption, equipped head-to-toe with exosuits powered by nano-fusion crystals.

Linker Class: They prefer to stay as far away from the battle as possible, while controlling machines and hacking into digital vaults from the safety of their homes, all through next-gen BCI technology which enables them to interface and control machines with the Riffs of their thoughts. They are meditation gurus, drug addicts of Fria, and E-Sports Superstars, and what all of them have in common is they spend far more time in virtual worlds than the default.
