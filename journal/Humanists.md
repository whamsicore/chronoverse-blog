## Humanists

"I just want to be allowed to live as an organic, non-genetically modified, non-cybernetically enhanced human being. Is that too much to ask?" 

The Humanist reject the Futurist obsession towards transhumanism with horror and disdain. They have banned cybernetics and gene modification. Instead of socialist policies of UBI, they have opted to curb mass employment by adopting a form of distributed manufacturing in a DIY revolution. Their infrastructure of production has become completely democratized and distributed to usher in a new age of independence and self-sustainability for and by the people. 

If you believe in preserving essential human values, such as family and religion and natural human biology, then you are a Humanist. As a Humanist, you gain exclusive access to: 

3d printing: Design and 3d print everything from cars to washing machines to guns. 
Crystal Batteries: Accomplished through principles of nano-fusion, crystal batteries are a symbol Humanist ingenuity. Just imagine holding a miniature power station in the palm of your hand. 
Exo-suits: With a society full of independent thinkers and tinkerers brought about by the DIY revolution, Humanists have become master craftsmen of exo-suits. Roboknights 
Heritage: The Humanists have found inspiration in the ancient cultures of the world, such as High Egyptian and Tang Chinese, and have seamless fused them with modern aesthetics. 
Community: Whereas most  Futurists have become socially isolated and spend most of their days deep in the virtual realms, humanists have opted to live in vibrant communities to keep our social traditions strong. 
Privacy: Whereas the Futurists use a form of digital currency that is controlled by the government, the Humanists use a form of digital currency that is more like digital cash, completely untraceable.  
Procreation: To put it simply, Humanists still have children, while many Futurists have volunteered for chemical castration in order to qualify for the waiting list for receiving life extension therapy when it roles out.

Humanist fashion is highly anachronistic, meaning it draws inspiration from fashions of the past. Russian and Chinese styles are especially prevalent since the destruction of Russia, and the Chinese Cultural Renaissance after the war.

Egyptians have become a nobility class since a deal was signed to give each Egyptian near unlimited access to clean, crystal fusion energy by its inventor, Taliba.
