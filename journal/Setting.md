"Chronoverse" is a sci-fi Universe that tries to explore the future of technology, both good and bad, brilliant and inane, in the most fun and social way possible, by taking you directly into the future. Get ready to embark upon a whirlwind journey into the land of next-gen tech, a world filled with dark secrets, sublime madness, and misguided heroes. Of Quantum Companies, digital governments, and cold calculating algorithms. Of super materials which have allowed man to build structures to rival the greatest mountains on Earth. Of spacecrafts that sail upon the electromagnetic waves of our Sun. Of realer than life virtual worlds. Of designer drugs and viruses that have given rise to entirely new species. Of men and women who hope to attain the power of gods... 



Futurists have replaced San Francisco with "The Wallace", a gleaming tower of technological perfection. While Humanist have divvied Oakland up into various culturally distinct neighborhoods.
On the one side, in place of what used to be the city of San Francisco, is the Wallace Tower, a city of cities rising up from the sea like a great tower of Babel reaching for the heavens. We cannot wait to have you join us in its high-tech, drone maintained interiors filled with millions of Futurists crammed into its multi-layered architecture (over 10 million people live here!). It really pays to be rich though, because a trip to the top, Paradise Islands, it will cost you a full Bitcoin, which is worth 1 million dollars by 2042. Then you can also catch the sunset over the Pacific Ocean at 4000 meters high, just as the super rich do on a daily basis.

3d model of the "The Wallace": At 7117 meters (over 23k feet), this Mega Tower made of Graphene Super Materials pierces into the clouds, and rivals the greatest mountains on Earth.

Side-by-side: We are just beginning to model the insides of The Wallace, so you can imagine what it is like to enter into this behemoth of a building.

A look inside: The pillars between levels are not only weight bearing, but also pump water and supplies throughout the giant mega structure, and serve as a convenient way of transportation for its inhabitants.
