## Futurists

Beneath a fa√ßade of peace and prosperity, a great war is brewing between the futurists who hold technology to be sacred, and the Humanists who would rather die than lose their beloved way of life. Their battle over energy, data, crypto currencies, digital votes, AI, automation, immortality, and control of Earth and Space will determine the fate of all mankind. 

If you hold science and progress to be the most essential values, by all means you are a Futurist. Facing the onslaught of mass unemployment, the Futurists opted to simply give the people free money. Perks of being a Futurist include:

UBI: Universal basic income. Free money!
High Standard Of Living: "The Wallace" is the most advanced city in the world, a city built and maintained by machines, where no one ever need to work...  
Mass manufacturing: Access to cheap, standardized, high quality equipment. 
Free Healthcare: Gain access to self-serve hospitals with robots surgeons hundreds of times more precise than their human counterparts. 
Designer pets: Gain access to genetically altered animals such as baby hippos, micro-giraffes, and even miniaturized dinosaurs! 
Cybernetics: Gain access to cybernetic enhancements for both aesthetic and function. Heck, feel free to surgically remove both your arms and legs and replace them with artificial prosthetics.

Futurist Fashion is both strange, stunning, and pragmatic. With the liberal use of smart-fabriks they are able to create novel shapes, colors, and designs. Cybernetics have also become a part of fashion, whereby individuals will voluntary remove their healthy limbs in order to replace them with artificial attachments for aesthetic reasons.

Designer pets are exclusively available to Futurists. Through the miracles of genetic engineering, you can raise your very own baby Dinosaur which only grows to the size of a Chihuahua (~$30k). Life extension tech for pets has also become available, so your dog can now live forever (setting you back ~$120k).
