  description: Payton Lee has zero qualifications for writing Sci-fi. But he's somehow
    set his mind to doing it, because allegedly, he saw a vision of a beautiful ancient
    civilizations, which he promptly labeled the Atlanteans, who achieved near singularity
    level of technology, and found a way to not be seduced by its power and become
    immortal gods. Instead they chose to slumber under the sea, for what they thought
    would be all eternity. From that day he saw that vision onward, Payton Lee became
    enthralled in the prospect of creating a sci-fi universe to tell that story to
    bring the Atlanteans to life. That sci-fi universe is called the Chronoverse.
    When he's not thinking about Chronoverse you can find him trying to convince his
    friends that Crypto and NFTs are the future!
